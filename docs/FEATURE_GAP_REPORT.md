## Executive Summary

Media Server Pro 4 has a well-built backend (30 modules, 215+ routes, 32+ DB tables) paired with a solid Nuxt 3 SPA. The majority of admin-facing functionality is fully exposed: all admin tabs call their corresponding backend routes. On the user side, most playback and library features are wired correctly. The principal gaps are: (1) several powerful filtering and sorting parameters that exist on the backend but are not surfaced in the UI (min_rating filter, is_mature filter); (2) the RSS/Atom feed and watch-history export exist as routes but have no discoverable UI entry point; (3) public playlist sharing is stored in the database but never surfaced to other users; (4) the `subtitle_lang` preference is stored and typed but the player has no subtitle/caption track UI; and (5) the "similar media" suggestions endpoint is fully implemented but never called from the player page. All P0 findings require only frontend changes — the backend is already ready.

## P0 — Quick Wins (Backend ready, just needs UI)

### 1. min_rating Media Filter

**What's missing**: The home/library page (`index.vue`) has no "minimum rating" filter control. The backend handler reads `?min_rating=N` and filters the result set. The TypeScript type already declares the parameter.

**Evidence**:
- Backend reads `min_rating`: `api/handlers/media.go` lines 35-38 — `if mr := c.Query("min_rating"); mr != ""`
- Type defined: `web/nuxt-ui/types/api.ts` line 121 — `min_rating?: number`
- Index.vue `params` reactive object never sets `min_rating`; it is never passed to `mediaApi.list()`

**Backend support**: YES — fully implemented, accepts 1–5

**Effort**: LOW

**User impact**: HIGH — lets users quickly browse only their top-rated content

**Suggested UI**: Star-filter control in the library toolbar (1★ minimum, 2★, 3★, 4★, 5★ only); bind to `params.min_rating`; clearing sets back to undefined

---

### 2. RSS / Atom Feed Entry Point

**What's missing**: `GET /api/feed` returns a valid Atom XML feed (auth-required). No UI link, subscribe button, or discovery text exists anywhere in the frontend.

**Evidence**:
- Backend: `api/routes/routes.go` line 357 — `api.GET("/feed", requireAuth(), h.GetRSSFeed)`
- Handler: `api/handlers/feed.go` — full Atom feed supporting `?category=&type=&limit=`
- Frontend: zero references to `/api/feed` across all files in `web/nuxt-ui/`

**Backend support**: YES

**Effort**: LOW

**User impact**: MEDIUM — power users and Archivist personas value RSS for new-content notifications

**Suggested UI**: "Subscribe (RSS)" icon-button in the library toolbar; links to `/api/feed`; optional popover with category/type filter sub-links

---

### 3. Watch History Export Not Prominently Shown

**What's missing**: `GET /api/watch-history/export` is wired and the URL is referenced in `profile.vue` line 443 as a `NuxtLink`, but it is inside a history tab area and may not be visible to users who do not scroll to it. No clearly-labeled "Download" or "Export" button is consistently shown.

**Evidence**:
- Backend: `api/routes/routes.go` line 387 — `api.GET(pathWatchHistory+"/export", requireAuth(), h.ExportWatchHistory)`
- Frontend: `web/nuxt-ui/pages/profile.vue` line 443 — link exists but placement is low-visibility

**Backend support**: YES

**Effort**: LOW

**User impact**: MEDIUM — data portability expectation; important for Archivist persona

**Suggested UI**: A clearly-labeled "Export (JSON)" button shown at the top of the Watch History tab, always visible regardless of history list content

---

### 4. "Similar Media" Not Surfaced on Player Page

**What's missing**: `GET /api/suggestions/similar?id=` is implemented and the composable function exists. The player page imports `useSuggestionsApi` but never calls `getSimilar()`. No "More like this" section appears below the player.

**Evidence**:
- Backend: `api/routes/routes.go` line 423 — `api.GET("/suggestions/similar", h.GetSimilarMedia)`
- Composable: `web/nuxt-ui/composables/useApiEndpoints.ts` line 167 — `getSimilar: (id) => …`
- Player: `web/nuxt-ui/pages/player.vue` line 10 — `suggestionsApi` imported; `getSimilar` never called

**Backend support**: YES

**Effort**: LOW

**User impact**: HIGH — content discovery is a core engagement driver; every streaming platform shows this

**Suggested UI**: "More like this" horizontal scroll row below the player, 6–8 items, rendered after media loads

---

### 5. Playlist Export Button Missing in UI

**What's missing**: `GET /api/playlists/:id/export?format=json|m3u|m3u8` is implemented and `usePlaylistApi().exportPlaylist()` returns the URL. However, no export button or action exists in the playlists page.

**Evidence**:
- Backend: `api/routes/routes.go` line 395 — `api.GET("/playlists/:id/export", requireAuth(), h.ExportPlaylist)`
- Composable: `web/nuxt-ui/composables/useApiEndpoints.ts` lines 221-223 — `exportPlaylist(id, format)` returns URL string
- Frontend: `web/nuxt-ui/pages/playlists.vue` — no call to `exportPlaylist()` anywhere

**Backend support**: YES (JSON, M3U, M3U8)

**Effort**: LOW

**User impact**: MEDIUM — allows integration with VLC, Kodi, Jellyfin; important for Power User persona

**Suggested UI**: "Export" dropdown on each playlist card (or inside the edit modal) with three options: JSON, M3U, M3U8 — each opens the respective export URL

---

### 6. Copy / Duplicate Playlist Button Missing

**What's missing**: `POST /api/playlists/:id/copy` is implemented and the composable has `playlistApi.copy(id, name)`. No copy button or action exists in the playlists page.

**Evidence**:
- Backend: `api/routes/routes.go` line 400 — `api.POST("/playlists/:id/copy", requireAuth(), h.CopyPlaylist)`
- Composable: `web/nuxt-ui/composables/useApiEndpoints.ts` line 219-220 — `copy: (id, name) => …`
- Frontend: `web/nuxt-ui/pages/playlists.vue` — no call to `copy()` anywhere

**Backend support**: YES

**Effort**: LOW

**User impact**: LOW-MEDIUM — convenience feature; Curator persona uses it to remix playlists

**Suggested UI**: "Duplicate" option in the playlist three-dot action menu; prompts for a new name

---

### 7. is_mature Filter Missing in Admin Media Tab

**What's missing**: `GET /api/admin/media` supports `?is_mature=true|false` (defined in `AdminMediaListParams.is_mature`). The admin MediaTab does not include this filter in the params sent to `listMedia()`.

**Evidence**:
- Type: `web/nuxt-ui/types/api.ts` line 163 — `is_mature?: string`
- Component: `web/nuxt-ui/components/admin/MediaTab.vue` — no `is_mature` in the filter object passed to `adminApi.listMedia()`

**Backend support**: YES

**Effort**: LOW

**User impact**: MEDIUM — admin efficiency for mature content management

**Suggested UI**: "All / Mature only / Clean only" dropdown in the admin media filter bar

---

## P1 — High Impact Features (Medium Effort)

### 8. Public Playlist Browsing

**What's missing**: The `playlists` table has `is_public BOOLEAN` stored. Users can set `is_public: true` when creating playlists. However, there is no public listing route and no frontend page for other users to discover public playlists.

**Evidence**:
- DB: `internal/database/migrations.go` line 125 — `is_public BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE`
- DB: `internal/database/migrations.go` line 124 — `cover_image VARCHAR(1024)` also stored
- Backend: `GET /api/playlists` (handler checks `session.UserID`) returns only the user's own playlists
- No public playlist listing route in `api/routes/routes.go`

**Backend support**: PARTIAL — data stored; a new `GET /api/playlists/public` route is needed

**Effort**: MEDIUM

**User impact**: HIGH — community sharing is a key differentiator for a self-hosted community server

**Suggested UI**: "Community Playlists" section on the home page or a separate browse page; shows public playlists from all users with owner name and cover image

---

### 9. Subtitle / Caption Language Preference Not Implemented

**What's missing**: `subtitle_lang` is stored in `user_preferences`, defined in the TypeScript type, and has a DB migration. The player page has zero references to subtitles, captions, WebVTT, `<track>` elements, or the `subtitle_lang` preference value.

**Evidence**:
- DB: `internal/database/migrations.go` line 57 — `subtitle_lang VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'en'`
- Type: `web/nuxt-ui/types/api.ts` line 39 — `subtitle_lang?: string`
- Player: `web/nuxt-ui/pages/player.vue` — no `<track>` element, no subtitle logic in 400+ lines

**Backend support**: PARTIAL — preference stored; no subtitle file serving routes exist

**Effort**: MEDIUM-HIGH

**User impact**: HIGH — accessibility and international users; required for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

**Suggested UI**: CC button in player controls; dropdown of available tracks; language preference selector in profile settings

---

### 10. User Type Management Not in Admin UI

**What's missing**: `config.json` defines four named `user_types` (premium, standard, basic, guest) with per-type storage quotas, concurrent stream limits, and feature flags. These can only be modified by editing `config.json` or the raw JSON editor in the admin panel.

**Evidence**:
- Config: `config.json` lines 116-149 — `auth.user_types[]` with 4 entries, each with `storage_quota`, `max_concurrent_streams`, `allow_downloads`, `allow_uploads`, `allow_playlists`
- Admin SystemTab.vue uses `configText` (raw JSON string); no structured user-type form exists

**Backend support**: YES — `PUT /api/admin/config` accepts full config updates

**Effort**: MEDIUM

**User impact**: MEDIUM — reduces admin friction for non-technical operators

**Suggested UI**: "User Types" structured table in admin Users tab with editable rows for each type

---

### 11. HLS Auto-Generate Toggle Missing from Admin UI

**What's missing**: `config.json` `hls.auto_generate` is false by default. No admin UI toggle exists; changing it requires raw JSON editing.

**Evidence**:
- Config: `config.json` line 158 — `"auto_generate": false`
- Admin StreamingTab.vue: shows HLS jobs and stats but no `auto_generate` toggle

**Backend support**: YES — `PUT /api/admin/config`

**Effort**: LOW-MEDIUM

**User impact**: MEDIUM — operators of large libraries need this toggle

**Suggested UI**: "Auto-generate HLS on scan" toggle in the admin StreamingTab HLS sub-tab

---

### 12. Personal Stats / Analytics Dashboard

**What's missing**: `GET /api/suggestions/profile` returns `UserProfile` with `total_views`, `total_watch_time`, `category_scores`, `type_preferences`. The profile page loads this data but only shows a brief summary. No time-series chart, category breakdown, or ratings distribution is shown.

**Evidence**:
- Backend: `api/routes/routes.go` line 428 — `api.GET("/suggestions/profile", requireAuth(), h.GetMyProfile)`
- Types: `web/nuxt-ui/types/api.ts` lines 59-66 — `UserProfile` with category_scores JSON
- DB: `suggestion_view_history` table stores per-media ratings, view counts, total_time, completed_at
- Profile: `web/nuxt-ui/pages/profile.vue` line 30-33 — loads profile; minimal display

**Backend support**: YES (data available for personal stats)

**Effort**: MEDIUM

**User impact**: HIGH — personal insights drive engagement; a staple feature on Plex, Jellyfin, YouTube

**Suggested UI**: "My Stats" tab on the profile page: total watch time, watch time by category bar chart, ratings distribution, recently-completed list

---

### 13. Download and Auth Config Not Exposed in Admin UI

**What's missing**: `config.json` has `download.require_auth: false` and `download.enabled: true`. These control anonymous download access. There is no structured admin toggle — requires raw JSON editing.

**Evidence**:
- Config: `config.json` lines 36-40 — `download.enabled`, `download.require_auth`, `download.chunk_size_kb`
- Admin SystemTab.vue: raw JSON editor only, no structured download section

**Backend support**: YES — `PUT /api/admin/config`

**Effort**: LOW

**User impact**: MEDIUM — security-sensitive setting operators expect a toggle for

**Suggested UI**: "Downloads" section in admin Settings sub-tab with enabled/require-auth toggles

---

## P3 — Future / Large Features

| Feature | Gap Description | Effort | Notes |
|---------|----------------|--------|-------|
| Subtitle/Caption Serving | No VTT/SRT file discovery, serving endpoints, or player track-switching UI | HIGH | `subtitle_lang` pref already stored; needs new backend module |
| Chapter Markers in Video | No chapter detection, storage, or seek-bar chapter display | HIGH | Would require ffprobe chapter extraction + new DB columns + player UI |
| Two-factor Authentication (2FA) | No TOTP or passkey support; password-only auth | HIGH | High-value security feature; auth module extension required |
| User-to-User Playlist Sharing | No mechanism to share a specific playlist URL with another user | HIGH | Needs shareable token routes + public viewer page |
| Watch Party / Synchronized Playback | No real-time sync across sessions | VERY HIGH | Requires WebSocket broadcast + host/guest session model |
| PWA / Installable App | SPA works on mobile but no installable PWA manifest or service worker | MEDIUM | PWA manifest + caching strategy |
| Content Collections / Multiple Libraries | No named library collections | HIGH | Would require new DB schema + routing |
| Parental Control PIN | Mature content gating uses age-gate, not per-user PIN | MEDIUM | Separate from mature preference; needed for Family Admin |
| Metadata Scraping (TMDB/TVDB) | No external metadata source; relies on filename-based categorizer only | VERY HIGH | New integration module required |

---

## Backend-to-Frontend Exposure Gaps

| Route | What it returns | Why users would want it | Frontend work needed |
|-------|----------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| `GET /api/feed` | Atom XML of latest media | RSS subscription for new content | Subscribe button in library header |
| `GET /api/suggestions/similar?id=` | Similar media items | "More like this" on player page | Row below player |
| `POST /api/playlists/:id/copy` | Copy of playlist | Quick playlist duplication | Three-dot menu in playlists page |

| `GET /api/metrics` | Prometheus metrics | Developer / ops monitoring | Link in admin System tab |
| `GET /api/docs` | OpenAPI spec JSON | Developer integration reference | Link in admin footer |
| `GET /api/admin/media?is_mature=true` | Mature-only media list | Admin mature content review | is_mature filter in admin MediaTab |
| `GET /api/media?min_rating=N` | Rating-filtered media list | Browse own top-rated content | min_rating filter in library toolbar |

The following routes are wired but surface area is under-visible:
- `GET /api/watch-history/export` — link exists in profile.vue line 443 but placement is low-visibility
- `GET /api/playback/batch` — called via composable for progress overlays; correctly used

---

## Data Collected but Not Displayed

| Data | Where it lives | What users could do with it | Notes |
|------|---------------|----------------------------|-------|
